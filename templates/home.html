            <p>
                HeyÂ ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tom. Iâ€™m an aspiring Computer Scientist and have a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and how it can advance human life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by technology. I had dreams of having the perfect smart home; watching consumer videos on YouTube and always wanting the latest tech. However, around two years ago I had a switch in mindset. I went from wanting all of the tech to wanting to make all of the tech.
            </p>

            <p>
                Around March 2020 I began to learn Python. At first, I really struggled, gave up many times and decided it was too difficult. Plus, balancing this with schoolwork was quite difficult. Luckily, I had a global pandemic on my side with a lot of free time. Once I decided I really wanted to learn and make a career of this my learning process was really expedited. Unfortunately, by the time I had made this decision properly the lockdown was over and I was back at school. It was manageable but difficult.

            <p>
                In January 2021 another lockdown was in place, meaning that, again, I had huge amounts of time to learn. I took advantage of this time and became a fairly decent programmer. I wasnâ€™t really creating a portfolio of work but I had acquired the knowledge I needed. I continued to learn at a steady rate. Picking up information along the way.

                And that brings us to now, skipping lots of surplus information which you can read here. Iâ€™d call myself a fairly advanced Python developer now. I know lots of information about a broad range of programming topics and finally feel confident enough to start building a portfolio. Iâ€™m currently building a network for my family home which incorporates all of our smart devices, some of which Iâ€™ve created myself, and consequently, the server that the website youâ€™re currently reading is hosted on.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you for reading this. Hopefully youâ€™ll now feel compelled enough to follow my journey. Thatâ€™s what these portfolios are for arenâ€™t they?
