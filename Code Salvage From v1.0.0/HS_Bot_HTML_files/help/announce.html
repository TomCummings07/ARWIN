Oh I see. You’re having trouble with the /announce command. This is a tricky one.

So, let’s get started.

<strong>The syntax is below:</strong>

/announce [recipients] [message]

<strong>Example:</strong>

/announce everyone Hello! How are we all today?

<strong>Explanation:</strong>

The recipients must be separated by whitespaces as each word is counted as a separate argument. The message can have as many white spaces as they want as the words are stitched together and passed as one string.

You can pass multiple recipients like so:

/announce tom michelle Hello! How are we today?

Or even notify everyone and then certain people individually:

/announce everyone tom john Hello! How are we all today?
